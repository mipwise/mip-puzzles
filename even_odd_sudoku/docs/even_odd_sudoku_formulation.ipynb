The first attempt could be to define a set of variables $x_{ij}\\in\\{1, \\ldots, 9\\}$ for $i, j \\in  I$ which correspond to the digit that must enter cell $(i, j)$. Although this formulation is possible, it gets harder to establish the constraints later (why? Try yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we propose the following decision variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_{ijk}$ for $i, j, k \\in I$, where $x_{ijk}$ equals $1$ when digit $k$ enters cell $(i, j)$, and $0$ otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a first glance, this may seems an over-complicated formulation, but it will save us a lot of effort while setting the constraints. Note that in this way, we have a bigger number of variables, but they turn out to be binaries!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "With the rules of the puzzle in mind and with the decision variables defined, we now establish the constraints precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Each cell must have exactly one digit*: $$\\sum_k x_{ijk} = 1\\quad \\forall i, j\\in I.$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here, a pair $(i, j)$ corresponds to one cell in the 9x9 grid, and since the variables are binaries, the sum over $k$ above ensure that one, and exactly one, of the $x_{ijk}$ is set to $1$. Therefore, the unique $k$ for which $x_{ijk} = 1$ represents the digit that enters cell $(i, j)$, which guarantees the desired constraint. There would not be such constraint if we had defined the decision variables in the other way.\n",

    "- *Digits can't repeat in each row*: $$\\sum_j x_{ijk} = 1 \\quad \\forall i,k \\in  I.$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The index $i$ corresponds to each row on the grid, while $k$ stands for each available digit. Then, given a row $i$ and a digit $k$, the sum over $j$ guarantees the existence of one, and exactly one, $j$ such that $x_{ijk} = 1$, i.e., only one $j$ for which the value $k$ enters $(i, j)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Now, for a given bold region $b\\in BR$ and a given digit $k$, the sum over $(i,j) \\in b$ above ensures that for exactly one cell $(i,j)$ in the region $b$ we will have $x_{ijk} = 1$, i.e., digit $k$ in cell $(i,j)$.\n",
